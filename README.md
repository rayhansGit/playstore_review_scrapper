Thi scrapper is built with this library
https://github.com/JoMingyu/google-play-scraper

To run the scrapper, you can run the .py file and enter the id from the url.
For example: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.baba
the id will be com.rovio.baba

Inside the code, you can specify the count parameter which is set to 1000 in default, this means in each iteration, it will fetch 1000 review.
In line 53 you can specify number of data you want to collect.

For this code, I have seen redundant review fetched and I have not worked on it yet.
